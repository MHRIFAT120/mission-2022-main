            <h3>Build Corona Application</h3>
            <p>The sample app includes code to simulate server responses. When building an Exposure Notifications app
                based on this project, create a server environment to provide diagnosis keys and exposure criteria, and
                add code to your app to communicate with this server. If the app you build operates in a country that
                authenticates medical tests for COVID-19, you may need to include additional network code to communicate
                with those authentication services.</p>
